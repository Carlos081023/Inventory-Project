## Executive Overview

In the dashboard, key indicator such as total inventory received, total inventory dispatched, and total available inventory to date. Additionally, a cumulative inventory trend report that tracks stock levels throughout the year, allowing for a clear view of inventory fluctuations over time. I also developed a product-specific restocking report that highlights which items need replenishment and which are adequately stocked. To provide a comprehensive view of inventory health, I included a total inventory availability rate, reflecting the percentage of stock currently available.
